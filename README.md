# NPM Notes

These are a few notes I've written up relating to Node and npm.
A decent amount of these relate to my setup working on [asteroid-js](https://github.com/asteroid-music/asteroid-js), which is written in TypeScript using webpack and Babel, with testing in Jest.
Thus, these are the main areas that these notes explore.

## Contents

These notes follow a general semblance of order, with a couple of branches and digressions thrown in there.
That being said, if you plan on going through in a vaguely linear fashion, follow below:

1. [npm](https://github.com/JR-Mitchell/npm-notes/blob/master/notes/npm.md)
2. [webpack](https://github.com/JR-Mitchell/npm-notes/blob/master/notes/webpack.md)
3. [Babel](https://github.com/JR-Mitchell/npm-notes/blob/master/notes/babel%20with%20webpack.md)
4. [React](https://github.com/JR-Mitchell/npm-notes/blob/master/notes/react%20with%20babel.md)
5. [TypeScript](https://github.com/JR-Mitchell/npm-notes/blob/master/notes/typescript%20with%20babel.md)
6. [React + TypeScript](https://github.com/JR-Mitchell/npm-notes/blob/master/notes/react%20and%20typescript.md)
7. [Jest](https://github.com/JR-Mitchell/npm-notes/blob/master/notes/jest.md)

A few of these have associated demo folders:

- [webpack](https://github.com/JR-Mitchell/npm-notes/tree/master/webpack-demo)
- [Babel](https://github.com/JR-Mitchell/npm-notes/tree/master/babel-webpack-demo)
- [React](https://github.com/JR-Mitchell/npm-notes/tree/master/babel-react-demo)
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/JR-Mitchell/npm-notes/tree/master/babel-ts-demo)
- [React + TypeScript](https://github.com/JR-Mitchell/npm-notes/tree/master/react-ts-demo)
- [Jest](https://github.com/JR-Mitchell/npm-notes/tree/master/jest-demo)

Also, [here's](https://github.com/JR-Mitchell/npm-notes/tree/master/notes/npm%20arguments.md) an odd digression in which I attempt to pass optional arguments to npm scripts in a way that feels aesthetically pleasing to me.


I hope this is useful to anyone reading it.
